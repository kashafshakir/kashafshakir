👋 Hi, I’m @kashafshakir

💻 I'm a Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

🌐 I have hands-on experience in full-stack web development, building projects using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

🧠 I actively enhance my problem-solving and algorithmic skills through daily practice on LeetCode, focusing on efficient and scalable solutions.

🤖 I’m exploring Machine Learning from scratch, working on projects like “Regularized ML Models with Optimization Analysis”, gaining practical experience in model building and optimization.

👨‍💻 I’ve developed practical web projects like SnapNews and iNotebook, combining clean UI design with robust backends.

🎯 My goal is to create intelligent, scalable applications that leverage AI and ML to solve real-world challenges.
